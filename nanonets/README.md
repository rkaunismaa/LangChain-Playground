[A Complete LangChain Guide](https://nanonets.com/blog/langchain/) 

### Module 1 - Model I/0

* Key takeaway is that which model I load into LMStudio matters AND re-running the exact same code against the same model with the temperature set to 0.0 does NOT ensure we will always get the same response!!
* You have to try different models to see which one appears to work for the given task at hand! ALWAYS look the the LMStudio Server Logs to understand what is going on!
