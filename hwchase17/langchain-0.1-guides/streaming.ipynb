As a very simple example, we considered it to be table stakes for LangSmith to help users easily create datasets from existing logs and use them immediately for testing and evaluation, seamlessly connecting the logging/debugging workflows to the testing/evaluation ones.\\\\n A unified platform\\\\nWhile each of these product areas provide unique value, often at a specific point in time in the development process, we believe a great deal of the long term impact of LangSmith will come from having a single, fully-integrated hub to do this work from.
