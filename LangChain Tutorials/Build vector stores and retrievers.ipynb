Given a query, we can embed it as a vector of the same dimension and use vector similarity metrics to identify related data in the store.\n",

    "LangChain includes a suite of integrations with different vector store technologies. Some vector stores are hosted by a provider (e.g., various cloud providers) and require specific credentials to use; some (such as Postgres) run in separate infrastructure that can be run locally or via a third-party; others can run in-memory for lightweight workloads. Here we will demonstrate usage of LangChain VectorStores using Chroma, which includes an in-memory implementation.\n",
