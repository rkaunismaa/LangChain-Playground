The notebooks in this folder will be generated from the [LangChain Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/) documentation.

I think a meaningful workflow will be to create these notebooks against OpenAI and then duplicate the final working notebook to something else and then run that notebook against some local model served up through LMStudio. Yeah. Created an 'LMStudio' sub folder and will copy the notebooks into this folder and keep the name unchanged.

The LMStudio model that seems to work is hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b.
